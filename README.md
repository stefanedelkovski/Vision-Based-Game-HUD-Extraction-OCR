# Vision-Based Game HUD Extraction OCR

Vision-Based Game HUD Extraction OCR is a computer vision project focused on extracting structured information from video game HUDs (Heads-Up Displays) using deep learning and OCR techniques. The system processes game frames or streams, detects HUD regions, performs text recognition, and exposes results through scripts or a Flask-based inference API.

### Structure Description

evaluation_images/  
Sample images used for testing performance or training evaluation.

inference_flask_scripts/  
Supporting scripts used by the Flask inference server for request handling, preprocessing, and postprocessing.

model_inferences/  
Stored inference outputs, logs, or prediction results generated by the models.

models/  
Pretrained model weights and configuration files used for detection and OCR.

node-scraper-v3.1/  
Node.js-based scraper used for collecting frames, such as extracting frames from video sources.

yolov5/  
YOLOv5 detection framework used for identifying HUD regions and visual elements.

app.py  
Main Flask application entry point. Runs the inference API and exposes endpoints for HUD extraction.

---

## Environment & Setup

env.yaml  
Defines Conda environment (Python + dependencies).

requirements_og.txt  
Original pip requirements list.

node-scraper-v3.1/  
Supports scraping video frames or resources via Node.js.

---

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/stefanedelkovski/Vision-Based-Game-HUD-Extraction-OCR.git
cd Vision-Based-Game-HUD-Extraction-OCR

If using Conda:
conda env create -f env.yaml
conda activate vision-hud-ocr

Or using pip:
pip install -r requirements_og.txt

---

## Usage

### Start the Flask Inference Server

python app.py

The server exposes endpoints for submitting game frames and receiving extracted HUD information.

API endpoints (verify in app.py):
POST /infer    - send a game frame and receive HUD extraction results
GET  /status   - optional health check endpoint

---

### Run Inference on a Single Image

python game_detection_efficientnet_inference.py --input path/to/image.png

This script runs the detection model on a single frame and outputs HUD-related predictions.

---

### Stream or Batch Processing

python stream_worker4.py --video path/to/video.mp4

Continuously processes video frames, applies detection + OCR, and aggregates outputs.

---

## Purpose & Use Cases

- Automated game analytics
- Esports data extraction
- HUD reverse engineering
- Vision-based telemetry where APIs are unavailable
- Dataset creation for game-related ML research

---

## Notes

- Models and thresholds may require tuning for new games or HUD layout.
- Some scripts are experimental and intended for research use.
